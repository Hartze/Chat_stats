Darude isn't really dubstep
dubstep would make jjjjj goin crazy and win the game (dubtep is awesome)
music chooses the input
house > dubstep
Please don't request songs. It is not possible to play anything other than the automated playlist at this time, as BPP himself is asleep. Thank you for listening.
This is incredible
Music is relative. It neither sucks or is better

Did he already win a fight?
Yeah...

@The_wastelander The bot wont mute streams YET. Only VODs and it will scan in 30 min segments and mute the entire thing if copyrighted music is found

thanks to knuckles
by the music?
These new twitch regulations are gonna LOVE this VOD
LOL
Lag on a ____ plays pokemon stream?? Damn your computer must suck

You know what Karmanade
Hi PogChamp/
:)
TPP is on, thy
Kappa they streaming
u need to randomized the keys
ve been playing Pokemon stadium 2 for awhile now
[asking for it intensifies]
Why didn't Tim advertise the "COPYRIGHTED" part of this stream?
Theyre streaming Stadium 2
TPP is everywhere Kappa
Some ti4 content got muted because the bot heard dota in game music on stream. xD
Once again Beatsboys?? They're isnt many bands in that playlist
I have a Royalty Free song that could be played ^^
There are. there's just a lot of beat boys
beatsboys Kappa
What lovespokemon500?
Kappa we have music, fish, and gamble now

BEATS BOYS HYPE
Tim likes beats boys.
All older music it seems
Sneaky Snitch - Kevin
haha twitchplayespokemon had over 200k views for a while now they cant break 1k

DansGame

never over 200k
it's like e with the tree
yeah :( but the fish is always sleeping
yeah
useless fish
Jjjjj feels cornered. Plz donate
up
ACTION must again iterate that NO requests can be met at the current time. BPP is asleep, and as such, the stream is being automated. Thank you for your concern.
DansGame up or riot
Well you appear to not want to respond Lovespokemon500 ...
will he ever make it out of that corner ?
Smart tho

Screw the fish, i was perm banned from that chat for no reason
Someone needs to make beetsplaypokemon

BEEEP
I think this has turned into more of a radio channel...
BIUP
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
ikr
I BET GRAYSON IS GONNA DIE BEFORE HE FINISHES
How about TrafficPlaysPokemon? An algorithm analyses a traffic cam stream, using the movement of traffic to correspond to certain button movements.
time played: 892 hours.... Status: one level 6 pokemon, still in home town
jesus
why not hamster does pokemon?
amazing Kappa
can't break away from this corner OpieOP

Im not complaining, theres more gameplay here than in timthetatmans streams Kippa
If there was no pokemon I wouldn't be here in the first place... AsianGlow
JESUS, WHY ARE PEOPLE WATCHING POKEMON FailFish
Have itunes and the fish take it in turns
Ponyplayspokemon
Fish plays Pokemon
have a Beats or Fish voting system
cuz I have no life :( Kappa
Because they want to, Nyan26.
we vote who we want to play it
Anybody watches phonecats?
0
This is stupid <____< lol
Now if only we had Tim's soothing voice to accompany :(
>_<
:')
The beatles Kappa
:'(
This is more interesting than FPP, by the way. BloodTrail
4Head it was around 120k at rocket maze @Icantthinkofausername69
What happened to Lovespokemon500 ?
@-%+&-
dubstep would be funny
>:)
O:)
4Head
ACTION Right now, this is just a first test so things may break a bit. Apologies if certain tracks aren't loud enough to trigger the action or if the stream gets stuck for half hour blocks at a time playing bombastic prog-rock anthems. I'd like to implement some community audio voting system one day but for now it's just my iTunes library.
:'(
Needs Ariana Grande <3
because... WE HAVE MUSIC BloodTrail <3
flashplay i saw at 200k
ResidentSleeper
4Head quaxo
i want to play pokemon but i don't want to use my own body to do so BrokeBack
Wowo
B-)
need oregon trail theme music
:-o
I'm lagging so hard
<3
Wait, why is this guy doing random crap, is the music actually doing the game?
hi
Maybe
Nyan26 yes
it's the equalizer hitting the yellow fields
ACTION has to iterate that NO REQUESTS can be met, as the stream is currently automated and the streamer is currently asleep.
lol lag
does it affect the audio if I choose low quality ? 4Head
Tnx Wookueemario
ResidentSleeper zzz
tf is this
DBstyle that strange because almost all my friend from red and almost there
2SPOOKY BibleThump
Of course it's Goemon music
spoopy japan time BibleThump
Kreygasm
sp00py azn
What's your quality set to, Right now, LovesPokemon500?
3 spooky 5 me :(((( BibleThumb
its laggy
*always there
How far has it gotten?
:-*
I remember him playing this game. That was like three years ago
this song is cute BibleThump
weeb heaven BibleThump
try speaking english flash
It's about as far as the fish
this pokemon trainer have not touch grass yet
rekt 4Head
Ausitn its my comptue that was causing lag
uh he has touched grass
anyone else waiting for possible death by double hurricane
ACTION would like LovesPokemon500 to know that he can popout the chat and close the video window.
or we couldnt have gotten charmanderino
neither has the fish panda. but that could be because it is a fish
Orion I am
But I'm on Oahu so I should be fine
4Head iyes
How did he finally get the Windows Gadget to capture? Did he use the double Xsplit trick?
we need to touch the grass again
wait wut
the hekll
Kreygasm
!shuffleinputs
MOTHER 3 MUSIC Kreygasm
Wouldn't it be hilarious if a huge error message popped up saying "RAM access violation"
I was being half serious, an actual bro islander
Mr Saturn OpieOP
Guy Hagi op
Kreygasm
Maui here btw
I think it would :P
this seems to be the most random *** music in the world ^^
this needs some Lemming95 music
Maui is so much better than Oahu.
getting on and off strong wind.
Super jelly
It's probably his entire music folder on shuffle
video games and beach boys
kind of scary at times.
Oahu > Maui
I need to listen to the music though
what happens when the stream gets censored by twitch?
!shuffleinputs
http://strawpoll.me/2293553
there we go
:O
omg
MOTHER 3 hypE
beats is better, but fish is betta OpieOP
whatsup
4Head
if by censored you mean the VOD, nothing much
just muted
Shrekt.
yeah, muted
What's up
http://strawpoll.me/2293564/r
eeeeeeelenoooore gee i think youre swag
we have a charmander named A
that's pretty much why this channel was created really
his isn't really a serious channel to begin with
Groovy Kappa
CYKA
unless Tim is being serious with this channel.
He might read the description Orion
Kappa
What you need to do is analyse what bars get the most inputs and arrange the buttons they correspond to in the order of most required to press.
Though this is Tim's main computer and people want their fill of RCT
And he has to move to dorms next week
Yah
4Head @Icantthinkofausername69 here's the link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon
there's that too
that would be hard because you get different music
so this won't be a regular thing at all
ops sorry
his laptop would explode if it was
What town in this?
I need permission
"This article is outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information"
Yeah, but certain things will always get more than others.
First one
I might have a computer
I can do this 24/7 on*
why are there 3 down "buttons", but only 2 for every other direction?
You'll usually have more High than Low, for instance
Because there are 16 bars for 8 buttons. And there's no select.
OBAMA SUCK
And you don't need 2 start buttons
^
mid range frequencies are the most... you only get highs because of cymbals or snare or such
can you beat pokemon red without opening the start menu?
Mabye change one of the down inputs to a randomizer/shuffle input button
no
http://www.gigapause.com/public/album_photo/9e/78/02/27428_a833.png?c=7540
and the mid range is pretty scrambled regarding buttons. so it's ok
because of the HMs
right poke flute
and hms
Hi my name is Freddy Cappuccino Pasterino from Google. Your stream is in playing copyrighted materials and must cease and desist immediately. Failure to comply will result in no more Cappucinos Kappa
oh right and pokeflute
minimun start menuing?
GRASS
GRASS HYPE
Will this be the song to get us in the grass?
NOOO
GRASSSSSS
hoping there's some moderation on suggestions, otherwise there's going to be loads of sandstorm, dubstep, 4'33" and misc ear bleeders OpieOP
and the hype is gone
DAMMIT
PogChamp grass
baby hold on to the grass
Yes he's out of the corner
CMON LET'S GET AN ENCOUNTER PogChamp
Yeees!
ACTION Sighs
I mean this is functional, to a certain degree, I'm just saying there's probably a way to optimise it.
well least music beaten the fish in getting to the grass
Noo!
^
Back in the corner FailFish
SAVE HYPE
is that 3 hours played?
Kappa
at least he saved

We need some right beats

Its ok guys he is just saving 20 times to prepare for the scary world outside the grass
Remeber when we had som much right beats?
Phoenix Wright will save us

Fish plays Pokemon > Beatsplaypokemon

alright, this is it, i am switching over to "rock plays pokemon" Kappa
Too bad it isn't more downbeat.
COURT IS IN SESSION OneHand
Fish one is better.
2 minutes in and Nick is disappointing me, but I still believe.
OpieOP mod, I think we didn't even need poll for that question
maybe FPP would move faster if there were two fish in the tank NinjaTroll
Ay stfu I love that fish and I mean literally in love I wanna *** it
The fish thing is cool in the way that it's awesome that they can do it. But out side of that not really.
pls respect Grayson Kappa
hen we'd need ana or dem for the fish
Is this still a thing? TriHard
TriHard
TriHard yes
Almost there... DansGame

Yep

K, bored of this, back to gambling on Stadium Kappa

When it reaches red?
J, you can overcome your fear of grass
When a bar hits yellow
when a frequency hit's yellow.
Okay
But because of the rate that they hit at time some notes aren't registered.

Up drumbeats Kreygasm

Rival now has six badges
I can't believe i've actually been on here for like 4 hours
Whoops. My finger slipped
same here
G
this is not healthy
this project looks dashing
how long did it take for TPP to finish the first time
it's because of the music. and the exciting playstyle in town
Put black/death metal on??
we are wasting our lives
Where are the song picked from
A very very long time.
The songs are picked from BPP's iTunes playlist
I just got here yay
picked from the top 40 in the UK Charts
Can some one please explain what sleep is?
TPP wasn't that long
sleep is for the weak
he got a fish picking the songs. pretty hitech stuff
It's this thing for the weak. 0/10 wouldn't recommend
Thank god we saved
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
no one
left needs some buffa
What is he doing?
:'(
maybe Tim shouldn't have replaced a up with a down.
it seemed like a good idea at the time.
He's having second thoughts
so do we not input any buttons?
Confusion is his epitaph you see
:)
J's a timid guy
So he's crying in the corner
He doesn't want to fight
the fish is so interesting .-.
I'm telling you  he's just trying to glitch through.
It's ok J
he's trying to be like cosmo.
or sig
That grass doesn't bite....kinda
whoever
J = WinWaker
those *** string intruments make him go mental... poor ash
Look at him, going back and forth
you can't tell him how to live his life Kappa
He doesn't know what he wants to do
The grass dont hurt you, but the pokemon do
wtf
He just wants to sit in his corner, but the grass calls for him
this pokemon trainer is mentally disabled
Oh god
should add the !songrequest command and play it through chat requests
The weather channel DansGame
Sim City

WOH WOH WOH WWOH
!songs on

DID YOU CALL HIM ASH?
this guy dunno wat 2 do

Streamer is currently asleep

Seems like anything can play Pokmon
Except a Fish Kappa
Hey

IM THE FISHES POKEMON
to the fish
C:
This song will never reach enough bass to go up.
SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE Keepo
nothing
I'll have my pants play Pokemon
Hey. This is as far as the fish
pretty jazzy, i like it
the fish is just alive
Dem saves Kreygasm
I love how the progress seems to be directly related to the mood of the song
he's slowly going up.
funny thing is the grass is the first obsticle. But when we get to the part where we need to run through the safari zone to get strength then we are doomed
kind of
YES! A WORTHLESS SAVE!
RYTHUM
saveeeeeeeeeeeee
save
no mention of the ledge? DansGame
BRB gonna have some breakfist
aaaaaaaaaa saaaaaaaave
he needs to be saved from the madness
no mention of Sabrina's Gym or Koga's Gym
the *** fish played for about 40x as much and this isnt as far as the music with 4 hours... so yes... music is better than fish
fffffffffffckn save
lol
this would be perfect with Plug DJ
TIL: Jazz is bad for controlling actions
fish stuck in the same place
the fish and music are at the same exact spot
best
im enjoying this a lot more than the fish one
the ***
the funny part is if we'll just end up here as there's not a high chance j will go into a Poke center.
bottomm right corner of palet town
can we suggest songs?
next track
Sadly no.
can't start a jazz riot here :(
im using the music her while watching the fish cuz it silent
bring plug DJ  Kappa
but i like both
Here's a word cloud of chat so far http://i.imgur.com/IwlH9W6.png :)

I don't know why, but  really like that picture.
Cool pic
perfect bass line timing. DansGame
FISH. MUSIC.
haha thanks
it captures the chaos in the short 4 hours this stream has been up.
You know, if we could request songs, we could actually have a small degree of control as to where things are going.
sandstorm forever
Yeah but the problem is this 1 was created in about 7 hours time or so
that's what suggestiong would bring
And the streamer is currently asleep
play chopin
that's planned, thewizardninja
look below the stream
popcorncolonel which website do you use for that?
Huh. cool
some drum and bass would get us somewhere i'm telling you!
Song requests Kreygasm
It's a program I made completely on my own, you can check out (and use) the code here: https://github.com/popcorncolonel/Chat_stats
Persona Hype Kreygasm
I'm surprised we haven't heard more Persona.
Guess who's requesting Sanic Kappa
Sanic hasn't helped really
we only heard one P4 song and now one P3 song.
this is in the same computer as Beach Boys DansGame
guess who's asking for it
dis movement at the beginning
we've heard more Sanic than Persona.
maybe you should use the pokemon opening
The blue demon is back!
This SONG Kreygasm
Oh
only triple q, beat boys and knuckles have done something
well... this song is doing some work ^^
this is ridiculous
This song is getting us MOVIN

Ffffffffffff
It's nice to see it some what working.

PJSalt
though to be honest, this kind of thing is what i imagine the new policy is trying to curtail
4Head OMGScoots Kappa Keepo TinyFace TooSPicy
Vods will be muted Kappa
Just wait until this stream hits big time like fish Kappa
This is awesome
that is actually why this channel was made FourSwordKirby
this isn't really a serious channel
Who chooses the music?
a fish
it must have wont the rival fight, lol
*won
no one, it's Tim's playlist.
iTunes chooses the music off the owners playlist
Can we see Tim's playlist?
randomized the keys!
Wtf is going on
You're going to get a lot of beach boys
this is being beat by a fish....... HAHAHAHAHA
left
Tim loves his beach boys.
and beatles.
Fish and beats are tied
Hey everyone! Google employee here. Looks like you guys are having a good time GreyFace. Just a friendly reminder to link your Google+ account and avoid streaming any copyrighted material. Game on!
Kreygasm music
Well, if you jumped into my playlist you'd be swamped with Barbershop half the time.
Do I ban teh google employee?
actually it's the opposite... music is beating the fish!! fish been playing for 160h and is as far as music with 4h
nuuu
anarchy Kappa

Songs ok
"Technology is incredible" - Apt
GO GTA SAVE US
there are not enough up presses for us to make it to viridian
GTA seems to like to save.
this needs tweaking
a lot.
jjj probably went down 6000 times and up 20 times
I want more p3 music
I'm waiting for it to quit itself.
Select isn't an option so it can't
almost 4 hours Hype
Needs more Arrows less Buttons like A B and Start
up
up should be where that mid-high down is
palllet town hype
lefr
left
Tim should have just kept it at 3 up and 2 down.
What is this
this song ...loves to check pokemons Kappa
But then we never would have left the lab
we would
btw jjj moved a bit...progress
eventually......
this is about the same as the lab to be honest.
maybe there needs to be some constant randomization of the inputs?
Too much mid in this
God we where so close and now where back here
\
Yeah, there seems to be a trend of "right" and "down"
thats because there are 16 buttons for 7 inputs... one down input should be removed. 2 direction inputs for each direction and the rest is fine
/
It doesn't want to be Out Of Touch with it's pokemon... Kappa
Right is unavoidable because of where it is on the analyzer.
the fish stream is better
Down is due to the 3 down options
That's what I'm saying the inputs need to be shuffled
City escape please
the direction keys are more important than a and b though
The kinks Kreygasm
this is just a first test anyway, nothing to be too serious about.
Technology is incredible!
come on guitar! get us up!!!
This song is so Kappa
This song was on Hot Fuzz, lol
There should be 1 less down and 1 more b Kappa
girl called Day Z Kappa
atleast the fish knows what hes doing
take one down option and replace it with a randomizer
We are doing it :D
YES WE MOVED
of ***
oh..
nvm -_-
2kinky
yep. remove one down and replace it with a randomizer would be good
Still in pallet town?
j's having a mini seizure.
he just really wants to clip through that wall.
Rival now has all 8 bades
and be like cosmo and sig.
!songrequest /watch?v=MLeicQZKuK
he really likes the save button
Orion you mean jjjjjjjjj Kappa
Rival suddenly remembers he has a rival
I'm too lazy to type his full name.
and maybe a cooldown timer on the randomizer
oh hey, More Beach Boys Kappa
Oh god is text on slow XD
Beats boys
Just call him JJ
A button boys
Beats boys are back to save us
JJ Abrams
I always call rival gary and my guy Ash
Is
It
Not enough flare to call him JJ
On
Slow?
This song is not going to help
jjicefish Kappa
best pokemon player ever JJ Abrams
He likes this town
JJ's contemplating drowning himself.
There should be a skip option
this song's too sad.
Hope not
its icejjfish
http://steam-cards.com/?click=a8e6e4
Needs some edm to get the progress going
skip music
Fish is progressing more than us now...
Sonic CD will save us
we need some happy songs not those tame quiet ones
possibly
Daz im sorry XD i was to busy laughing
GOTTA GO FAST
well this will work
Toot toot Kappa
we can still see deleted links in chat Kappa
Sonic Kreygasm
Volcania
SONIC R OR RIOT!
Sanic!
Lol
Gotta go FAST
Play Tip toein in my jawdinz
gotta go fast
no, Sonic CD is just spazzing out the menu
no saving today.
Wtf is this
wow, it's really spazzing out the menu.
Sonic tony Kappa to slow
Beats plays pokemon
This is *** hilarious
Sonic. What are you doing. Sonic. Pls staph
So how is this getting past Twitch's draconian music copyright policy?
inb4 game reset because of this "start button" song
That output console Kreygasm
It's not.
it only mutes the VOD
this is *** mental :D
that's it
Is this the fish?
That's only on VODs
No one cares about you're charizard
Persona Kreygasm
So for everybody wanting dubstep and the like. That exact same thing is going to happen.
Oh ok
that 16 sec persona song.
its going to fast Kappa
Rival is now at elite 4
aaaand it's done
Goemon gotta cath em all
Rival IS elite 4
PLAY AMENO
I'm bout to cry
Pressed a
now Goemon is spazzing the menu.
in a somewhat rhytmic beat.
Lol
ayyyyyyy lmao
you could this song is A+
The system is too sensitive
it won't go anywhere
lol, it's actually spazzing rhytmically.
From song with all mid to song with no mids
A+++++
Check your items again i bet you'll find something Kappa
The lowest frequency should be a randomized input instead of A over and over. lol
b
Just gotta refresh the inventory
We need the dark renamince of coffee
The item box is on beat its killing me XD
If I press item enough maybe on will show up Kappa
one*
jjjjjj is checking to make sure that fat guy didn't eat his backpack
this is a fail
Juju
Copier
This song XD
2 minutes of items.
This is so cool
I think this is the first song that did that.
This is gay
PROGRESS BOYS
We need Pyoro's auto bot.
atleast it waant on save :D
I think we need to make a rule
wasnt
Don't be dicks
Lol^
_ BLUB BLUB BLUB BLUB  _   _ AVENO  _   _ BLUB AVENO BLUB BLUB  _   _ BLUB BLUB BLUB BLUB  _
Seems reasonable
the start option being in the song is hilarious! necessary? xD
That's kinda of a universal rule
first rule: dont get banned
NATSI MODS
Autobot? AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM timBBQQT
Could we build a system to vote on the songs ?
an unbiased rng will use days on 1000% speeto get to the first city, this will take ages, the fish will use even more time.
I wonder how Dubstep will look like
speeed to*
Lel
Dubstep pls
yeh some wubwub will surely catch pokemons :D
come the *** on mr tim and remove one down button... pleeeeeaaassssseee
Hey it's MEEEEE!!!!!!!
Dubstep or riot
DUBSTEP
It's all fun and games when your petting pichu until you touch it's cheek SuperVinlin
Dubstep will wreck havock
Good luck completing the game this way :D
DUBSTEP OR RIOT
Dubstep t(-_-t)
DUNSTEP
DUBSTEP
it's going to release every pokemon.
Dubstep will most likely spam the start buton
If the game is completed like this I will eat a shoe lace
TO BIRD JESUS WILL BE FOUND
remove 1 down button or riot
remove 1 down button or riot
Lol very true Clyde
Guys
Dupstep sucks
least the text speed is back to fast.
being stuck sucks more.
still would like to see how it would react to dubstep
Mods enforcing their communist regime ideas on the chat Kappa
stubdep
Specifically, it needs to be the down button right next to the up button. And it needs to be replaced by another up button.
We seriously need better songs though
4 hours, still in Palett Town... Good luck Beats...
biased mods Kappa
COMMIES?1
Lol
Bro I'm American
Riot mods t(-_-t)
THERE SHALL ONLY BE BEATS BOYS AND SONIC MUSIC PLAYING!
160h still in palett town. good luck fish
CHARMANDER'S NAME = A (A = ANTHONY)
the mods need to since they can't on Tim's real channel Kappa
any progress?
not really
Does touching the grass count?
not with this music
hey link
It took RNGplayspokemon months to beat at 400% speed
he was in the grass once
Hi Popcorn
remove 1 down button or riot
what would happen if we played dubstep music
He was :o
Is this the troll face in twitch ?Kappa Kappa
he touched the grass and has been trying to be like cosmo and sig.
WE ARE GOING UP :D
I can't believe someone has a fish playing Kappa
Stop that Mnzol
A lot of start button spam would happen with dubstep
247 viewers Kreygasm
How did Red even get to owning a pokmon?
rngplayspokemon took 969 h to beat crystal and they are +3000 h in emerald and still not beaten
Magics
Go JJ go!
Aww
My crappy Lua script that presses buttons is nice xD
Well, at least we're not back in a building like the fish is right now
What is happening?
JJ's just making sure A is still there.
i'd expect vba to hate it and break
This is stupid.
what is the rival's name btw
Put song on repeat we need up
he will be more succesfull than the fish^^
AAAAAAA is the rival's name
gg
He needs to do something
This music is extremely good omfg :)
wat ..
indeed
the gameplay sucks, though
That is why we don't need dubstep
ALL THESE UPS WE'RE MISSING
Need money urgently help please 180689890575 wm
Like charmanders stats haven't changed. You can stop checking him now
What console is this on?
3==
yup, A is still there JJ.
whats the setup?
BEATS BOYS HYPE
May I he thinks just poking A will make it do things itself.
Need to decrease the amount of A's being played
The streamer was a DJ for awhile
Yolo right
tim really like beach boys, huh?... ^^
My jam Kappa
It's his favorite band
Yes
whats the setup? wich programs he uses?
this music is so good though Kreygasm
What's with this music
you'll have to ask link.
Plz no
link made the thing
SPAZ XD
Xsplit to show output console, itunes, and game
well at least they get us somewhere. i dont know where, but at least somewhere
The song should be sampled really badly play us the music, but then sample it to one bit per second and use that average as the control
OBS to stream the analyzer
how long has this been running?
Analyzer is a Windows 7 Widget thing
4 hours
Energydrank, A Specturm thing, Lua script that reads a txt written by a Python script that checks the pixels from the spectrum
ok
I am a best
this is so much better than the narcoleptic fish
Energydrank, Rest is just usual stuff, music is itunes, xsplit for stream and etc.
watching grayson is boring, this is more interesting
Energydrank, The Lua script is being run by VBA-RR
Narcoleptic fish XD
omg

thnx link2006
less people spamming the chat here.
What's this?
See, what we need to do is but Start at second from the left, because it gets pushed so infrequently, part of the reason why we aren't going up.
Haha lol
XD
yeah, the other chat is full with blubs
timOh
Goemon
I'm surprised we've been hearing more Sanic and Goemon compared to P3 and 4.

Kappa
DARUDE
Energydrank, i forgot

Darude sandstorm Kappa
I kinda wonder what dubstep would do
Friday is best song
***
*** Darude and his ***
CoD also got a 10 on IGN so reliable source Keepo
c:
this is just a warm up, because on the chance on if/when we get out of here we'll only just end up back here since it's less likely JJ will go into a Poke Center to heal.
darude sandstorm
Never more from p4 would be sick
Trust Johnny he knows whats up Kappa
Dubstep would have too many button inputs and it would move things at a kind of slow rate. But probably spam either A a lot or start
Say darude sandstorm one more and it shall be a timeout
Fish get 11 on ign Kappa


Rekt Kappa
Oh ok

What he needs to do is replace the up button that's second from the left with a start button, swap the existing start button with a down button, and make the down button two places from the start button an up button.

SCEPTILE WINNING
If you guys don't pick bulbasaur its a perma ban

Play some Nevermore :U
darude sandstorm is about dududududududududududududududu
Its going up :D
Make a strawpoll for the two tiedones
Play some 70s Prog Rock
http://strawpoll.me/2294064
Take on me by A-ha
make a strawpoll about how good darude-sandstorm is and how you should play it next
lovespokemon500, Are mods able to skip songs if we use nightbot?
Play Journey!
Song HOW do you not know what love is? Kappa its clearly baby dont hurt me Kappa
This is so *** lol
we should go watch the fish play pokemon
Elephant yeeeaaahhh
I don know
Darude - Sandstorm
ELEPHANT Kappa
so what starter did Jay jay choose?
Elephant
Oh wait, we did just have King Crimson
But i would skip untill we get to city escape
banstorm
fairly sure there's an option so mods can only use nightbot commands.
If Darude is so bad why was it at Ti4 After Party? Kappa
Sarude - Danstorm
Bulbasaur
I've seen it in other streams.
so, how is this going?
yeah, if you use nightbot for a playlist, mods can delete songs from the queue
i hand catch my starter in the water
5 hours
ur dum!!!!!!!!!!
I hope this project doesn't get to flooded but i hope you get at least 1k
THAT'S NOT CITY ESCAPE SwiftRage
I don't think Tim's going to take this seirously to be honest.
fish will be longer than this
play an
plus he has to go to Grad School soon so this won't be regular.
plz what is the visualizer you are using?!?
pokemon song maybe u will get to an gym leader :^)
fish will never exit pallet
Delete all songs city escape only
xD
who knew a music could play better than a fish
Darude Sandstorm only Kappa
Da rude sandstorm
Rickroll or riot Kappa
Yea....what Bobbyj03 said...
darude-sandstorm will get you out of this city
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6NaZrPQGfY
darude sandstorm is too mainstream for this ***
fish defeated rival m8
JJ has too.
music too
I feel like this will take 10 years to complete, lol.
they should make a tournament making non human things playing games
So had we
JJ had a pretty sick clutch.
Play Town Escape instead, that way we can escape Pallet Town Kappa
but darude-sandstorm is what you need to be productive in life and stuff
What happens when you run out of Pokemon and the beats don't press the continue button?
what continue button
I remember ther's a song request function in Nightbot, maybe it can be used?
City escape is amazing :D
Red telephone Kappa
Got places to go gotta follow my RAINBOW
you just white out to you previously healed
tim
Sparklekat, As long as we don't soft reset (we cant) we stay in game
OPERA OR RIOT
either your home or a Poke Center
tim!
Oh
tim
Sparklekat, you cant get out of game
wich visualizer is this?!?
a fish is more productive than this and he listens to darude/sandstorm
theres a tim ?
so in the grand scheme of things 3we'll be here forever since when/if we get out of here we'll just end up back here since JJ will probably not heal at a Poke Center.
nope fish is not more effective

people are taking that way out of context
Same thing :p
not really
i wonder how pokemon battles look like

Kricketune for Stream Mascot
banning it means you can't watch it
Lol it is stuff same place as fish

BibleThump
Twitch plays pokemon insighted a religion
it doesn't work also, pressing space twice makes you able to hear the audio
Muting it :p
Orion1759, that was fixed
Do the beats have any badges?
#mobile4lyf
http://strawpoll.me/2294113
Orion1759,  doesnt work anymore
confirmed if you cant get this far in pokemon you are worse than a fish and music at playing it
oh

This needs some slayer
Orion1759, you can still download the VOD and audio is still there
yeah I know
winamps?

that guy is ruining JJ's clip.
BibleThump only 2 votes
This is pretty cool
how does this work?
We're running music (or, well, any audio really) through a frequency visualizer and once a frequency hits a certain loudness threshold (the yellow bars), it presses a button in-game.
Elephant is the best
Does the music have have any badges?
Why am i not on the list? Kappa
You guys subbed to machinima? You guys see the video on twitch?
Elephant is love
Sparklekat, no

In order to achieve the highest level of fishiness, one must convert to the religion of the Fish and give them self up to the one and only Fish. We're true fish worshipers, we ride together, we die together. #fuckoffsharks copy and paste this if you have converted to the religion of the Fish.

We're running music (or, well, any audio really) through a frequency visualizer and once a frequency hits a certain loudness threshold (the yellow bars), it presses a button in-game.Right now, this is just a first test so things may break a bit. Apologies if certain tracks aren't loud enough to trigger the action or if the stream gets stuck for half hour blocks at a time playing bombastic prog-rock anthems. I'd like to

What is the pint of this lol
I just thought about it
I luv dis wind!!!1111 Kappa
ELEPHANT
well. hopefuly if and when Tim rewatches this he'll tweak the thing for songs like these.
If we get Frequency specific audio, we can create our own input
Kreygasm
Lol i am the only votrer
wait, stream is not down, by having copyrighted music?
or remove songs like this entirely
Dafuq is this wind? xD
oh well at least the guy making this is trying something new
Matriks404,  no
http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/08/3136/ they're just muting the VODs that's it, the live streams are unaffected.
plz i rlly wanna know wich visualizer this is
I was looking at the controls. Wondering why there was two v's but no downs. Then I understood...
nice concept, but can use some tweaks
Lol
Tigerblade79, yes
Me since i can ban you XD Priceless
When will this song END!
Wait so it has to go to te top for him to move ?
timBBQQT
yes
the yellow bars
it has to go to the yellow part to do a thing
Should also put a timer at the top
This song is from Mother 3 when you're on a cliff outside club Tittiboo, hence the wind.
PRAISE THE ELEPHANT DON'T FALL FOR HIM
If i were the streamer, i'd do it now
Ouhhh yeeeeeahhh...... BibleThump

100+ hours I think
I think 160 hours
What controversy Kiikasi?
Please Note:  Audio Recognition applies to VODs only.
LoZ HYPE
Stuck in the same place
http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/08/3136/ they're only muting VODs that's it, nothing is happening to live streams.
fish has a huge popularity boost, but this has more technology and groove in it
Jokes on you we have a twitch cop here.
The elephant will rescue his prophet out of pelettown
that too

We know, man. We not that instupid BibleKappatump
novelty
@Tims_ceiling Twitchplayspokemon, the thing that inspired this. It's where 500-100K people all control the same game of pokemon by typing commands in chat.
there's also an RNG playes pokemon
http://free-steam-cards.com/?click=ba438d
Mods please
The point is to watch music play a game... >.<
Yeah
why would i want steam cards Kappa
Say that aloud again Rocketboy901
Hi
I don't think it inspired this
it isn't
Tim just sort of ripped off the name, true
and then think whether you're spending your time wisely.
this is just Tim being crazy
Mods goddamn it
@Orion They play the best music on RNG plays music
Steam just wanted people to spam Twitch
Tim made an RNG based Pokemon thingy way back
Twitch Kappa
PogChamp
true he did.
gogogogo
Yes
We called it Drunk_Tim
I miss those streams.
PogChamp
The. point. is. to. watch. a. non living. thing. to. play. a. game.

Are you all watching this stream ironically?
HAIL BEACH BOYS

He played regular Pokemon Crystal, and had a Bing Translated game and Vietnamese Crystal playing in the background
He was controlling them all with the same input
you brought the hopes and dreams and crushed it
twice
How do I say commands
most of us know of the guy who made and are just watching for the novelty
the point is to watch what happens Kappa
yeah, that was pretty funny.
I want someone to base a dance routine for these songs off the moves it makes.
You can't
no commands, music controls
Dance
I liked his random pokemanz streams

Viridian hype!
Tim's probably going to laugh when he wakes up
Can't wait for tim to wake up and see this
It is either: Watch a fish do NOTHING(Still cute fishy though), Bet on Stadium, or Listen to music and chat.
Is tim still sleeping?
I wonder how many viewers this will get.
*
U
yes
Or watch some other stream
I choose the third option hands down
If we can pick songs... can't we just pick a song that goes a certain direction

that would require figuring out how to actually make a song go a certain way though
I'm still betting on stadium, but I either lost my money, or I'm rich.
HAIL THE FISH

TaiNs0, 7 hours

btw. have they tested the original pokemon music?
Taishaun, 7 hours *

Why are random people mods
NightBat dont try me i do it Keepo just i dont know the difference between a time out and a ban. i think i accidentally permabanned someone yesterday cause i fun banned him (on request) and he never camed back BibleThump
TLSO has betrayed us

Ah
JURASSIC PARK IS FRIGHTEING
Kappa//
Brb
JURASSIC PARK IS FRIGHTENING IN THE DARK
Pioxys banned a Starmie Kappa
Murugo, buuurn :D
FISH
Fish is so big lmao
FISH MUSIC
We're making so much progress Kappa
If he does a ruby or sapphire he needs a lot of high brass music lol
ALL THE DINOSAURS ARE RUNNING WILD
MUSIC FISH
Made it out of pallet town?
TriHard Pioxys...
SOMEONE SHUT THE FENCE OFF IN THE RAIN

NightBat funny thats why i banned him Kappa
first time whited out
FISH MUSIC Kappa
Have we fought our rival yet?
The chat isnt that bad now :)
I ADMIT IT'S KINDA EERIE
BUT THIS PROVES MY CHAOS THEORY
Keepo
Can someone go back and edit this part to have dramatic FX
not after pallet. no
AND I DON'T THINK I'LL BE COMING BACK AGAIN
OH NO
You know compared to fishplayspokemon
Derude- sandstorm
DUBSTEP! SwiftRage
I CANNOT APPROVE OF THIS ATTRACTION
the chat was kind of worse earlier
Darude Sandstorm needs to be on this iTunes
DARUDE SANDSTORM
Hitler wasn't that bad
I like this chat, you can actually talk here without getting spammed out by old memes.
Hey, does anybody know whether the !songrequest feature is programmed?
inb4 "guys, what is this song" Keepo
CAUSE GETTING DISEMBOWLED ALWAYS MAKES ME KIND OF MAD
ROCK PLAYS POKEMON IS BETTER LOL Kappa
NightBat this is better honestly. Fish is just there to be cute. its like a mini sea world in a bowl.
I kind of feel like Tim should take this offline until he implements the song request. So the hype doesn't die before it's super interactive.
lol
Tirgo, i think your capslock is broken KappaHD
A HUGE TYRANNOSAURUS ATE OUR LAWYER
Derude- sandstorm or gtfo
I think Tim is at work
This is better than fish plays pokemon because no fish are dying
The song request is under 'future updates'
inb4 inb4 "guys what is this song" Keepo
We lost 150 followers
WELL I SUPPOSE THAT PROVES
InvisibleUp, not yet
Hitler was a bro
THEY'RE REALLY NOT ALL BAD
inb4 inb4 inb4 "guys, what is this song" Keepo
Hype can be reaquired, by the way of new features.
FPP would be better if there was a piranha in the fish bowl
JURASSIC PARK IS FRIGHTENING IN THE DARK
Hitler was just misunderstood Kappa
or 2 extra fish
>.>
You aren't really inb4 that then, latias.
Tirgo this isnt weird al
ALL THE DINOSAURS ARE RUNNING WILD
Alright, I was thinking about making a HexChat plugin or something.
inb4 inb5 inb6 inb7 Keepo
Guys, what is this song?
@Reecer6 Keepo

I'M AFRAID THOSE THINGS'LL HARM ME
@Leonys2 hi Keepo/

I wonder if we can make it into the pokecenter.
That would be amazing
When did that happen timBBQQT
AND THEY THINK THAT I'M THEIR DINNER, NOT THEIR FRIEND
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NightBat if  there was better music i be making fan art of this of a neku like styled red/Jay but i cant when im listening to stuff from the 60s DansGame Kappa
I wonder how long JJ will get to the mart
The stream layout is fine, you cant really ask what song is it without being a troll
has anyone been affected by the copyright ***?
JURASSIC PARK IS FRIGHTENING IN THE DARK
ALL THE DINOSAURS ARE RUNNING WILD
This sounds like the music they play on the cinema ads lol
Oh. Apparently new mega evos were confirmed for Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire. Salamence, Altaria, and Lopunny
the copyright only affects the VODs http://blog.twitch.tv/2014/08/3136/
WHAT A CRUMMY WEEKEND THIS HAS BEEN
The copyright has affected vods, not liv streams i think
Twitch totally deserves this
Kreygasm nice
I can't wait until we get the first VOD of this and like, one 30-minute chunk isn't tagged as muted for some reason.
WELL THIS SURE AIN'T NO E-TICKET
Jurassic park is always frightening, because the electric fences keep going out!
Yeah Mega Altaria is Fairy/Dragon
oh hey
Fish plays pokemon Kappa
THINK I'LL TELL 'EM WHERE TO STICK IT
in the mart
Even twitch channels vods have been affected, its horrible
PLOT PROGRESSION
CAUSE I'M NEVER COMING
BACK THIS WAY
not gonna get modded at this rate :(
AGAIN
Did we beat the league yet
You know, as much as Tim doesn't care about viewers, I wonder how much this stream will impact it.
now how long until back to Pallet
OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy daaang

Let's not save
Can we all start calling the streamer Tim Senpai
Pokeball wizard
or nearly any
only 4 Persona 3 songs played and 2 Persona 4
^
lucahTim
that music
everything else was Beach Boys
It works, dont complain
gonna go watch a stone playing pokemon
oops
CONSOLE LOSE CONTROL
It probably isn't, beats too stronk to the emulator to follow
Seriously I really want to see what would happen with either A: Death Metal or B: Touhou
BeatsPlayPokemon, Yeah it doesn't , pokemon wants the input to be held for a bit, so if the note only hits for a frame it doesn't
Gotta make sure to save. lol
NightBat i wouldnt worry to much about that tim we made progress anyway Keepo
He stands like a statue cuz the song's too damn quiet
Tim, you're up!
I'm very disappointed in you Tim.
Tim we want City escape and snake eater back on
Dat grind
http://strawpoll.me/2295423
ugh
Why do these streams all choose charmander?
BeatsPlayPokemon, I could fix so it holds it for a few frames but it'd probably break more
We went into the Pokecenter but didnt heal A at all.
We beat fish
Is streamer Tim?
Yes
\ Keepo / finally I saw a battle
Dont do it link, its a bad idea
that music
Yes he is
NightBat yeah Iatias

We'll end up with Tim only glitches
well actually that's a half lie
Winning!

everything was Beach Boys, Sanic, and Goemon
It's funny that we are so good at battling

Would they be Youtube requests?

timGuest420
Pioxys is a starmie please ban Kappa
I posted this earlier: I kind of feel like Tim should take this offline until he implements the song request. So the hype doesn't die before it's super interactive.
Can't wait to hear the VODs of this
http://strawpoll.me/2295432
and we also got 18 min song that disappointed us
requests is gonna be hard :\
Because those end up in stupid mashups Kappa
play no tengo for the hell of it Kappa
ugh
NightBat you can prove that tarot. no i do mean it. can Keepo
http://strawpoll.me/2295432 For music chocies.
Vods will be muted
Requests should have a timer before a certain song could play again, otherwise it'll just be Snake Eater or Sandstorm constantly
DO DO do do
Kappa
Coolguy i don't see any Mother 3 or snake eater
ACTION puts a tag with the "Troll" name on Pioxys

Church of Helix Choir music PogChamp
NightBat i said that too tarot. PogChamp what funny is the rival name is AAAAAAAA so i like to think AAAAA and JJJJJJ are 2 halves of AJ PogChamp
That girl's name? Carole King. IT MAKES SENSE.
very very badly
By listening to Fear of the Dark obviously
Wtf wouldn't this channel be muted since twitch is going to copyright music
I wonder what'll happen if we put Giovanni's Wild Ride, Sinnoh Game Corner or Village Bridge on the stream Kappa

I mean banned by whatever the *** I mean cirRage
Celebratory dance*
and yet he's still traveled further than all NPC's bar one in this game
OpieOP
it's just muting, that's it
Actually, if we have a long segment of just, for example, Mother 3 music, that wouldn't be muted.
nothing serious is happening
@Showme_yourkitties Who's emote is that?
cirno
what this OpieOP
OPEN YOUR EYES J
cirno_tv that is
@Showme_yourkitties no the other one
the chances of evolution happening, is lower than this resulting in a beat game
So close
NightBat this song Kreygasm

I think Carole is the most progressive song i've seen so far.

A fish is any member of a paraphyletic group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers

Sandstorm happened earlier whilst delivering oaks package
I've been here for those whole 11 and hours...

derude didn't really make much progress to be honest
I'm more surprised it didn't hinder progress

also there was like 4 songs where it didn't reach green, like an ambient noise from Goemon
IWATODAI DORM OR RIOT SwiftRage
Its true, I saw him make this
NightBat idk what to do leo. talk to tim about it.
Kappa/ agree
@Beatsplaypokemon A pro tip: Never trust me with anything
Just barely beat you to it Emerald xD
that says Kappa or FrankerZ a mod Kappa
this is so awesome streamer 4Head
Tim, Do you have city escape?
I did too, Somenerd. It was fun
Hey tim have you sent out the shirt yet im still waiting for it?
ugh
NightBat CITY ESCAPE PogChamp
lol
City escape from Sonic Generations
Let's do Lavender Town Green beta version during all the stream Kappa
Make everyone that says Kappa or FrankerZ a mod Kappa
is there a platform/website thing that lets you recommend or suggest songs or youtube videos or something?
come on
And Pioxys is a Starmie Lover. He has fanfiction written too
Streamer picked random mods confirmed Kappa
Everyone deserves to be a mod, as long as they keep asking. That shows enthusiasm Kappa FrankerZ
and vote on it and pick it in the queue after one ends?
There's one that Stiv used
by the way Tim
change the title to music plays pokemon Keepo
I think there might be, streamer!
*hisses* It has to be the original City escape
Mother 3 hype!
How else is Pioxys a mod? Kappa
PJHarley @Beatsplaypokemon pandora comes to mind
ideally it'd also let you limit them by length
why do you have Derude in your playlist
Doesn't nightbot do that?
dammit Tim
Nightbot has that feature, also stuff like rainwave
@Beatsplaypokemon I feel like Grooveshark does that
so nothing more than 5-10 minutes
NightBat coyrn dont make me ban to unban you again DansGame Kappa
just curious
would something like plug.dj work?
Tim, Nightbot has a song request feature
Mother 3 Kreygasm
But 10-hour mixes are the best

NightBat done
Flash_play
Hi Tim Kreygasm
PROGRESS
MrDestructoid
Dash plays pokemon Kappa
WAT NO
NO CHANGE
test
:'(
What's going on Keepo
Okay now me typing won't upset it.
:(
WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T PRESS START
wait
Oh whoops
start is numpad
wut
You didnt do that originally? Kappa
Kappa/ hi beatstreamer
No, problem was that
ACTION AtIvy I said 69 seconds, not 600 seconds DansGame
no, that's how it works
Ok streamer EleGiggle
some keys were bound to my keyboard
MrDestructoid What's that emulator?
now it's time for helldemon music
BibleThump
PogChamp thanks
Oh yeah good idea
ooooh "spooky" music
and it was inputting as I typed.
NightBat Sylveon i unbanned ya the first 10 seconds tho didnt you read anything i said? BibleThump
Ah okay Streamer senpai, we love you BibleThump
that PC
2SPOOKY4ME EleGiggle
NO GO BACK TO THE SPOOKY MUSIC JK
music
MrDestructoid 2spooky BibleThump
oh JJ was being controlled by master for a bit
the silence BibleThump
Ok, so uh.
Hi guys nice jams 4Head
ACTION You never unbanned me DansGame
Kappa
I think I gotta make some changes on stuff.
RIP JJ
Kappa//
I want you guys to be able to vote for things.
Like what?
Yeah that would be great
Faillllz
I will report permaban as mod  abuse, if it happens without reason
Alright then
NightBat i typed it in like 10 times it said you was unbanned.
SHREK MUSIC PLEASE SMOrc
that would be sick
YES Kreygasm
I WANT SPOOPY MUSIC SwiftRage
!vote City escape
:) VOTING Kreygasm
At the very least, we should be able to vote on randomizing the buttons.
Yay voting PogChamp
also, so many inputs at once, not sure if I should speed the game up
I THOUGHT LOVE WAS ONLY TRUE IN FAIRY TALES
Let's play Bang Bang! 4Head
more rhythm tengoku
50% more or so?
it would be a constant spam of next song Kappa
lol maybe that would be a good idea
Bang Bang plz 4Head
oh god 150% speed HYPE
Yeah, it'd be good to speed it up
WE NEED SMOrc
x s
I never got uunbanned DansGame
PJHarley yea, more inputs is probably going to help this thing progress faster
speed up game
50 would probably be good
also also.
Yeah try to speed it up
Save Hype
fish is down, time to take over
Keepo I think I know who's ban me @Pioxys, it's not you
MOAR
MrDestructoid I told you to check
This is a problem I'm having that I can't solve right now
OR DARUDE SANDSTORM BloodTrail
Sylveon never got unbanned Kappa
NightBat really? thats weird DansGame
?
!woot !skip
Someone else must've banned me DansGame
Darude Sandstorm Kappa
MrDestructoid Keepo
I wanted certain genres of music to correspond to different buttons
!skip
!woot
BibleThump
due to different frequencies being more prevalent
dubstep pls
dubstep vs classical or something.
Guys, Darude already played
ACTION This is like the original TPP Red BibleThump
this stream is making up for the fact that plug.dj is down
SANDSTORM BloodTrail
too bad link2006 isnt here
almost out of the lab hype!!!
No, pls no dubstep...
DansGame once again permaban without reason I will report as abuse
sandstorm
WUBWUBWUBWUB
Sandstorm or rito Kappa
i have no suggestions... :(
@Beatsplaypokemon I think thats a tall order
Same, Crimson
NightBat NITHER OF THOSE THINGS WIN! TRACE HOUSE AND ELECTRONIC ARE ULTIMATE RACE
is there any code monkeys in here
And if I do that I'd have to make something like the lower frequencies certain buttons and the higher ones differentbuttons.
SANDSTORM BloodTrail BloodTrail
PogChamp another ban on Flash_Play?
Nightbat along with video game and anime music Kappa
I suggest Bang Bang 4Head
ShazamIcon
Ask your genius coding crew, Tim.
Jazz wins Keepo
MrDestructoid Nah, country is best Keepo
Shazamicon
How would you do that though
It's not a coding thing per se
shazamicon
When do you plan on adding song requests?
All I ask for is this song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0
it's just, what genre peaks certain frequencies
NightBat who keeps baning flash play? DansGame
4Head
@Beatsplaypokemon I also think that would take away the potential strategy of songs hitting certain buttons
man its saving a lot this song
Stivitybobo had a bot written that would take song suggestions. Contact him?
play stairway to heaven Kreygasm
there's no documentation on the visualizer I use.
PogChamp yes elite0blade mod permaban me earlier without reason
wher is bik bot?
Honestly the one I use is pretty terrible but it works with no delay and is pretty. :0
No i mean how are you going to change the layout per song?
Guise can we has Dar00d
try speeding up game first, then see what happens?
almost outside of lab hype, get hyped!!!
Do you have any Squeeze in this playlist?
NightBat elite0blade a mod????? PogChamp
Darude sandstorm will speed things up MrDestructoid
um, i think SANDSTORM is necessary in order to leave this predicament we are in right now.
Barry edit that out!
I do have some Squeeze
Kappa
i think you should only output when volume hits red
Yep we need sandstorm
Nice :)
Clearly, a mod Keepo
Love pokemon guess whos back Kappa
Strimmer add Revengeance OST Kappa
Do you have UHHHHHH in there, Tim?
OK, this is cool.
derude was actualy played in here
NOOO
Xlewisxx: I can do that
PRAISE THE SANDSTORM TriHard
Keepo slimo please
it iddn't really help at all
Kaapo
Keepo
We haven't left Oak's place in forever.
pornhub
Kreygasm nice streamer
that's not too hard, I'd have to restart the thing though.
NightBat wait.... elite0 is SLIMO??? PogChamp
I come in to Steely Dan. I like your taste
no problem
Also, we've been demanding No Tengo Dinero for a while Kappa
JJ has a crush on the girl there
Tim, when is the song requesting system? Do you have any ideas on how your going to do that? like nightbot or something or make your own?
How did this even get the package
MrDestructoid Have we saved?
if it was only when red I think the pace would be abysmally slow
BibleThump So i missed Darude?
Kappa
So hows everyone doing? Kappa
PogChamp yess
why not input for dark yellow?
No idea
I wanted to try nightbot, it looks easy.
SIMCITY
will cause less spam in output lol
and some songs would do literally othing
yeah, derude played a long while ago
I MISSED SANDSTORM SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
Not only did it get the package, it got the pokedex.
NightBat ban for dewgonging Kappa (jk wouldnt do that)
Oh, it did get the pokedex
DARUDE
sandstorm will save ussandstorm will show us the way
yeah
it is, i've used it. works fine as long as this computer your using could handle streaming/pokemon/youtube or soundcloud at the same time
Sim City 3000 did it
yeah it has a level 12 charmander
DARIDE
Kappa No, i'm not Slimoleq, she wouldn't be ban avading like that
Its done surprisingly well
what happened to FPP?
Tank you sim city
Sim City got us the package
How long have we been stuck in the lab?
SLIMO'S A GRILL PogChamp Kappa
JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
I like the idea and all, I'm just wondering what else to really do to make it... work?
DARUDE TriHard
hail sim city
NightBat she? i thought slimo was mall Kappa
PJHarley @Elite0blade the name reminds me of war0blade
or is slimo an oven? Keepo
Lovepokemon made a straw po asking if he could ban me Kappa
maybe randomize the commands
I get it's kind of wishful thinking to assume a song can control buttons decently
Ban the word Darude
every 30 minutes
Keepo
Keepo slimo is pokemon you know
War0blade <3
its a mix between Elite_tookis and war0blade right?
BAN THE WORD DARUDE EleGiggle
PJHarley i was right? <3
SPAM DARUDE
I'm worried about quiet songs. Maybe have spectro levels that are relative to a max reading
but I think if each button were at a specific frequency, dubstep makes it go more down, high frequencies make it go up more etc.
I believe in BPP
Thats just how it works i guess, you wait until it works
@Beatsplaypokemon Set up music voting and tweak from there I say.  Thats gonna be a whole new ballpark after all
I joke
Darude
reason for darude banned?
Dont spam darude
Darude will strike you down were you stand if you are anti-sandstorm!
Murugo: I was thinking if we used nightbot I could just have the ones that don't wok get skipped
yeah, it is
no more fish?
one button being a randomizer would be good I think
Hi @Elite0blade How are you
You should add more genres
PJHarley  i'm glad i was right :D
Would need constant attention
ResidentSleeper
pokemon soundtrack is my suggestion
But that's what mods are for Kappa
NightBat how bout we just suggest music for ya to add?
Can people not vote to skip in nightbot?
Persona 3 hype
PERSONA Kreygasm
oh hey 7th P3 song
PJHarley @Beatsplaypokemon could you make the commands "move" randomly? like, after each song or something?
NightBat besides sandstorm
oh man
Yeah, they can
PERSONA HYPE
PERSONA PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
P3 got JJ out the lab
People should be able to vote if they want to skip or keep the song.
over and over
this song works for moving around real well
This stream is so entertaini- ResidentSleeper
HYYPE
You might need more mods for Nightbot
Persona Kreygasm
and now it's stuck in the lab
But if I made the commands move randomly we'd never get anywhere
Tim you wanna make a private chat for this?
NIghtBat Aop its better then a fish swimming around Kappa
Oh man this song. Kreygasm
I was hoping we could use music to suggest more specific movements.
PogChamp persona 3, this is it
If only you could use a system similar to fangame safari's voting
BloodTrail
More Persona please Keepo
PJHarley @Beatsplaypokemon maybe, maybe not. that's the "luck" with randomness
again like certain frequencies being more linked to other buttons
while not constantly attending it
PogChamp I'm fine, thanks
DansGame
right now I have 16 channels and 7 buttons
PJHarley @Beatsplaypokemon we would need to know what songs do what then
Maybe try less buttons?
Smooth beats OpieOP
Dance JJ!
OMG PERSONA 3 Kreygasm
That never gonna end
we don't need the start button
ACTION MechaSupes He's dancing PogChamp
We *sort of do* but it's placement kind of sucks.
barry play some sandstorm!
the start button is for the pokeflute and HMs
<3
Streamer I love you <3
Love you too
whos barry?
Kreygasm
Gamegrumps? Maybe?
Kreygasm
from gamegrumps
Kreygaszm
STREAMER LOVES US BACK RitzMitz RitzMitz RitzMitz RitzMitz RitzMitz RitzMitz
Kreygasm streamer love
cmon Jay you can do it 4Head
Is there really any way you can control it? Maybe it's best to leave it as is.
GO TO PROF OAK!
it
<3 Love riot <3
it's gotten fairly far on it's own like this.
@Beatsplaypokemon Trial of no start button?  The music really cant make good use of it in any way like twitchplayspokemon can
Persona didn't help EleGiggle
we did it!
teh urn?
JJ I BELIEVE
ACTION MechaSupes @Vo14nte Rival in Gen 4? The one that says "I'm gonna fine you" Kappa
wait, doesn't this void the new terms of service for twitch? this music is copy righted
PogChamp
PERSONA PROGRESS
YES WE'RE GOING DOWN 4Head I think Kreygasm
P3 is somewhat helping
This is the first run to expect a bunch of problems.
The arcana is the means by which all is revealed.
Bpnds of people is the true power
the copyright only affects the VOD
YES 4Head
lol ok
Its good, and I think the only thing it really needs is voting, because people ask for it a lot
Wait
I am thou
and it only mutes it, that's it
WE DID IT 4Head
JJ is sure getting a workout i'll give him that
did the fish die?
WAIT WAIT
ITS WORKING PogChamp
MrDestructoid  Streamer can you lead us to Viridian City?
What?
How hard is it to analyze BPM?
:O
YES WE'RE OUT 4Head
NOT HARD
progress
WE DID IT REDDIT <3
Like, doing it live.
Sanic HYPE!
Uh, where are our nerds Kappa
Play some Cho Aniki music
out of lab hype!!!
PJHarley WE DID IT! <3

SANIC
DansGame Stop saying we did it reddit
where are Tim's nerd monkeys
I HEARD SANIC Volcania
WE DID IT REDDIT PogChamp
Use ameno
No idea ask a programmer Kappa
why isn't link2006 here
SANIIIIIIIIIIIIIC
BPM would work really well.
FailFish
SANIC Volcania Volcania Volcania Volcania Volcania Volcania Volcania
Like the music:)
or popcorncolonel
Kappa
Kappa I'd like to see level 100 grinded on the route 1
If so we could have faster songs do one thing
I am a programmer but I can't answer that question Kappa
up/down whatever
Someone page Popcorn, Murugo, Link, and the others from last night lol
frequencies as left/right maybe.
Yeah that might work
and a/b whatever.
I can't wait until Cut is needed Kappa
I had the BPM idea also, I'll investigate after work
Gotta go faster, faster faster, faster, faster! Kreygasm
PJHarley sounds good BloodTrail
SONIC X
oh murugo's been here
CHILI DOGS Volcania
just lurking
anyway does anyone mind if I speed the game up a little bit.
Slow songs can be movement. Fast songs can be used in battles?
I wanna see if it makes it more playable.
No, go ahead.
Not at all
not at all
MrDestructoid  Nope
NightBat go for it speed it up
go ahead
Please do.
150% HYPE
Nope, go ahead
go for it
PJHarley speed it up!
Moving at the speed of sound
i'd say speed it up a little bit
Whatever you do, it's still going to be "random".
well this is better than the fish
SPEED THE *** UP!!
The old games are way too slow for me.
speed it uppuh
YOUR TO SLOW Volcania
STEP IT UP TriHard
Gotta go fast.
Speed is fine

Gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster
it's the arrow of Tim, praise be the arrow of Tim
GOTTA GO FAST

SANIC IS PROUD OF US Volcania
Dancing TriHard
Gotta go fast, and up.

NightBat tim is the streamer
No, Grayson listens to nothing at all.
Grayson is evolving
bye tim!
Sanic saves Keepo

Wonder what Grayson's doing...
How long have you been here Pioxys? Kappa
No he sleep he's okay
Who is grayson guys? Is that the fish?
Yes.
Murugo, you there?
He's not dead, he's dancing
Yep]
grayson is getting buffed Kappa
What happened to the program you were making?
It analyzed sound via python right?
ACTION We needs ups SwiftRage
It's going well, the spectrogram values are off for some reason though
Oops used to saying /me Keepo

Okay, heading off.
They're completely different from the one on stream
Thanks for demoing this.
Bye
that timeout was fabulous
bye again tim
I'll leave it up and all.
Bye Tim
gg beats god
nice to see it's still in development, maybe we could use it for the BPM and stuff
At least we get to enjoy this persons fine selection of music:D
NightBat basically all day so far Kappa
l8r tim
It's not going anywhere, but thanks for putting up with it.
Ok cool thanks Tim <3
Anything I can do to help you guys? I cant code, but I could test or whatever
Kappa
He's saving more then Twitch Plays Pokemon did
I'm wondering if there's a BPM algorithm page somewhere
JJ got the pokedex
Thanks for putting up with us
don't be mean Tim
Hopefully it'll be better and my library doesn't suck *that* badly.
NightBat i was suppose to work on comics but the beach boys distracted me Kappa
Tim
Is there city escape?
Oh, I mean.
Just dont let us have another hour of flash fm Kappa
PJHarley tim your library is awesome
The stream isn't going anywhere, not turning it off.
@Beatsplaypokemon You have good taste in music
Also yes there is city escape
oh okay
Good
I'm not a huge Beach Boys fan, but I'm not complaining.
Nice XD
Tim forces me to like old music
Now to wait for it
I'll cue it up, why not.
NightBat nah your librrary is ok. justwe all got different taste here in this age Kappa
:O
Everything is good except Beach Boys but I'll live
how much internet data do u use up on this jeez
also
Is there a lot of genres? Kappa
Beats boys
beach boys if love beach boys is life
Do you have Majora's Mask music?
gotta escape from pallet town
I'm pretty much ok with any kind of music.
If we had my library hooked up instead, then I bet people would really be complaining.
it's also the false prophet
This may help
Also yes as well.
@Ghostly_raptor He does

NightBat JJJJJJJJ is going to get some daisy Kappa
Good luck!

MrDestructoid  Bye guys Keepo/
NightBat good..... vibrations Kappa
Alternate Version Kappa

@Iatias bye
excuse me, but what's ''TBB''?
ACTION MechaSupes GOOD VIBRATIONS Kreygasm
More beach boys! :)
The Beach Boys
NightBat of course the beach boys sing about vibrations Kappa
Kappa how much until Darude
Oh
PJHarley @Iatias bye

I wonder if Time has any SCARY songs..

Flygon <3
i miss darude
if there's a 30 second stream lag shouldnt the comments show in the stream first and make a time parado
Where are we now? Looks like out of pallet town?
Nope
!
pacifichell, that particular command is not yet supported. Point taken!
starting town xD
PJHarley @Theladyvanquish still pallet
bikbot
I love you too, pacifichell. KAPOW
ugh
PJHarley daisy map! Kreygasm
Uh
JJ got the pokedex though
somehow
map hype
But we're very close to route 1!
PJHarley bikbot is awesome BloodTrail <3
I love you too, soadsod1. PicoMause
we'll get there... eventually.
bikbot
I love you too, shadetempest. Jebaited
yay
I'd like to see a BeatsPlayMajora's Mask ;\
ACTION MechaSupes This song is just Kreygasm Kreygasm
Lol
Oh wait the visualizer at the top shows which button presses are which FailFish I am really tired...
I think i broke my keyboard.
I swear we should have opera music
give daisy some good vibrations Keepo
the problem with TBB is that they want to do good, but all they do is hamper JJ's progress.
i was the first requested opera
save Kreygasm
We should have The Most Unwanted Song.
i like fishplayspokemon better
Have the Beach Boys done ONE good thing so far?
We should play the Pokerap
I think we should have more sanic
I can't put 2 of the same leters together and i can olny delete one leter
PJHarley @Darkrose19 i don't like opera, i like classical with no singers.
So much instruments in this song :o
pokerap please! PogChamp
These are terrible vibrations
Sanic shall lead us to victory
@Soadsod1 I was kidding I don't listen to opera
EXTENDE POKERAP
Loves, restart the PC?
can i link musics here?
uGh
We should have more grand theft auto music
PJHarley @Darkrose19 :/ i listen to classical music
all GTA does is grind
ACTION MechaSupes WOOO PogChamp
beach boys confirmed for always *** us over
Alright than i gues i shal restart than
which is somewhat productive, but doesn't really go anywhere
!Skip
reecer6, that particular command is not yet supported. Ow!
can i link musics here?
@Soadsod1 I listen to classical very rarely
The program probably just needs a little direction bias. That would probably be fairly helpful
SKIP TBB FOREVER
Chat is moving too ReisdentSleeper
i gotta say, 10k channel views in a day is pretty good
Guy, we need to beat Misty!
so lame
ResidentSleeper
Se you sone guys
NO TBB OR RIOT
Why so much beach boys
Tim's love for TBB knows no bounds.

You're the only one rioting.
The only issue with a voting system is that you would have Darude - Sandstorm non-stop 24/7 Kappa
DARUDE OR GIOT
DARUDE DUDUDUDUD
I want to do the maths properly as a random walk but I'm scared of what the result will be...
that and 10 hour loops, and anime
How long have we been in Pallet?

LEVEL 12! Kreygasm DAT GRIND PogChamp
we need tim's hold on music
New fish
here's how we work a voting system:everyone will be able to add one song to the queue, and can change the song they're requesting at any time
A new fish
timDinero
@ Greg: Robotic legs
Grayson has his own WIKIPEDIA PAGE. how special. (   )
The other one died
we need some no tengo is what we need
NO NO NO NO timDinero
No tengo dinerooo
timDinero
He's contemplating his life. (   )
we. want. metal.

I know tim has no tengo dinero in his library
oh wow something new
its only a matter of time
I believe in you Dan
WHERES GRAYSON
Steamy Dan? Kappa

I hope you aren't street fighter Da
Poor charlie
Dan
What do we wand? Metal!!
:-)
Just curious, how long has this been going on? XD
WHO WANTS TO SEE A DINOSAUR
Did someone said they want Beach Boys? Kappa
Steel typing will help us
9ish hours?

O_O
12 hours, + 7 hours of prep
Jesus Christo.
oh 13
too many chill songs...
metal coming? :(
Okay this is actually good and fun to watch
We'll have a request system implemented soon
atleast some faster songs?
Will we have HEYEYAY one day?
Tim said he was going to look into nightbot
murugo, do you still have the "uhhhhhhh" button link?
nice that there is coming a request system bro! :)
One sec
OMFG imagine du step
I want that one song that starts off with "Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
Should do some of the.. popular "request" songs once, just to sate the chat.
TECNOLOGY IS INCREDIBLE
Technology is incredible!
Steely
PLAY FREEBIRD
TECHNOLOGY timBBQQT
Poor Charlie
FREEBIRD OR YOU SUCK.
INCREDIBLE IS THE TECNOLOGY
FREEBIRD OR RIOT.
Wow that tecnology, is really incredible.
CORNER :)
Not sure if people saw it before, but I had an idea for how a request system could work
MOTHER 3 TECHNOLOGY
LEVEL UP
A's gong to level up guys
it's a sign
"HOLY *** I'M GONNA DIE!" -NCS
My technology is more incredible than yours
needs less down
This need a randomize button, because every single music has a single frequency that uses all the time. (sry about my eng)
all Technology so good.
I vote an input randomizer is implemented
someone pick better musizzzzz
TBB DansGame
what about fish plays pokemon? did the fish die?
NO TBV
the beat sure is going on
Tim why is your love for TBB so strong
TOO MUCH BEACH BOYS
TBB*
Here it is myinstants.com/instant/uuuuuhhhhhh
THE BEACH BOYS RULE JJ
Tim number 1 TBB fan confirmed Keepo
I warned you about the beach boys
We should keel TBB
it's stronger than a thousand suns
Imagine loud music or like dubstep...
Triple save just to be sure
Murugo Kreygasm
Jet Set Radio
Bitz boyz
Tim is huge on beach boys, could you not tell from the pet sound shirt?
timBBQQT
The Beach Boys are one of the greatest bands ever, of course you're gonna play a lot of them
You never know when the system will shut down
wut? thanks internet you're awesome :)
Play Syrsa - Mad Machine
we need music like pop rock metal jazz rap etc.. so everbody will hear something he or she likes
If tim keeps a constant 200+ viewers, he'll get partner in no time timBBQQT
PUT METAL SONGS
TBB are good, but the thing is they only hamper JJ's progress.
EVERY GENRE OR RIOT
(   ) - (   )storm
"Needs more country" said nobody ever
and toy with the chat's emotions
gawdamn its like a trap
constantly
It's stuck selecting pokemon
He isnt taking requests yet sorry
In fact he isnt even here
Lvandia-tower....looking forward
Bullet For My Valentine - Tears Don't Fall...When you get the chance. :)
If a song voting system is setup, I'd imagine people would post frequency response test notes to progress
Put on Virtual Riot - Energy Drink, Its ROYALTY FREE!
SANIC
To be fair TBB work really well with this system
'Boss'
everyone would play sandstorm lol
dat bass
WORK DAT SUCKA TO DEATH
We're hoping the system has a vote skip option to discourage cheating
how do this workP?
SANIK CD Kreygasm timOh
nooo painkiller from three days grace!!!! :)
We need a song that starts with DUDUDUDUDUDDUDU
Sonic CD soundtrack; Japan or American?
UUUHUHU
japan
We're running music (or, well, any audio really) through a frequency visualizer and once a frequency hits a certain loudness threshold (the yellow bars), it presses a button in-game.
If the player is moving to the music... Could it be considered dancing his way though the game?
DUDUDUDUDU DUDUDUDUDUDUDU :V
Slipknot - The Negative One
Dududududududu?
wow, not the american boss music Kappa
down we go Keepo
we need NA NA NA from my chemical romance!!
Here's my suggestion for a request system:Everyone will be able to add one song to the queue, and can change the song they're requesting at any time.
Kappa
OneHand Yolo
Yellow*
HEYYY OneHand/
Gaydude-Penistorm
and the song being selected at random, because there are more than 10 people here

"GRAYSON IS GETTING AN UPGRADE" oh god
tim's laptop is already pudding.
fish be ded
Uh
yep thats a song
The fish got shrekt
jk i fd up
Graysons "Upgrade" is the owners of him going to get a fish that looks just like grayson because grayson died.
grayson will be back terminator style
Syrsa - Mad Machine
The fish is going to become the first cyborg fish. ;)
illumiati fish
Grayson's streamer is moving out.
Grayson's speed run Keepo
we can make him stronger, faster, actually move from time to time
wouldn't that be cheating if it became a cyborg
They can change the name. "CYFISH PLAYS POKEMON"
Progress anyone?
If the fish beats Pokemon I'm going to get a Grayson tattoo
Stronker Kappa
when he becomes a cyborg his erectile disfunction will be cured :)
wait wait, the fish died?
a is level 12 and palet town
Yeah the fish died
Twitch plays grayson Kappa
FISHY DED
Song: Darude - Grayson
JJ also has the pokedex
They're just saying he's getting an upgrade.
that's pretty much it
Can someone explain fish?
he also mastered saving
MY *** GOD, THIS IS TO MATCH AWESOME
I smell fish. I think my dinner is ready. EATING GRAYSON TONIGHT!
Maybe he should get a bigger tank, and two goldfish, and another betta. So the betta has something to chase. :D
fish plays pokemon based on where he is in tank.  the fish died so stream went down for "upgrades"
or he died or streamer moved or he will become a cyborg. CYBORG !

Grayson died in a car accident. R.I.P. 1969 - 2014 #1Like1Prayer

Disabling start would make progress
Ikr
Grayson died at 4:20 pm 69 seconds

Doroco
shame, would have been awesome if this song got us out of pallet town
NightBat RUN TO THE WAAAAAALLS! RUN FOR YOUR SIIIIIGNS!!!~
he probably is trying very hard to get to Viridian, but the song is freaking him out too much
He is still in pallet
One night, I am in bed, beating my wife, when phone ring. I beat phone, then pick it up. I hear voice. Voice says "What you do with my daughter?!"I turn to wife and demand to know why her father interrupt me beating her. But she say, her father is dead! Then, KGB break into house and arrest me for illegal possession of phone.
is that the first or second town

First
This is Pallet
Yeah JJ went a little crazy in that one
Let it go - Elsa of arendel plz Kappa it holds the code to release the charmander

Hi guysKappa /
Route 1 is IMPOSSIBLE!
dance JJ dance!
How does this work?
Hi Kappa/
DansGame a mutant joltik...
I'm confused... does it input when there is a red hit?
NO JJ. DON'T. YOU CAN'T SWIM.
IMPOSSIBRU
We're running music (or, well, any audio really) through a frequency visualizer and once a frequency hits a certain loudness threshold (the yellow bars), it presses a button in-game.
eyy lilmama lemee whispah in yo ear
THOSE DANCE MOVES THOUGH
What is it about X plays pokemon streams to where they always get Charmander
The JJ shuffle
For *** sake the fish picked Charmander
What happened a Joltik had sex with DBstyle and make a Child?
because everyone loves charmander
even the causality
WHAT IS HAPPEN
Cos Charizard too dank
fish betrayed his own kind and now hes dead for it
#enviadopelocaue
WHAT IS HAP(   )
charmander is easy as it's literally right there next to the player character
We need "She blinded me with science" to listen toBloodTrail
Yes
And charmanders story in the cartoon made everyone cri evrytiem

Kappa
NIghtBat anyone else i need to unban? im kinda busy of an ask comic im almost done.
(   )
thanks Pioxys <3
yay Ask Comic!
I really wanna know who made the bot, I really don't remember when it came in the chat.
NightBat Anytime :)
Maybe liquid helium from your local dodgy physics dept
I think somewhere around the 6 hour mark probably
It came in when I started watching.
when was that
Is the stream still on or did mine just turn off?
Around 11 AM EST?
Tim's done for now.
Is Tim not gonna stream today then :(?
It's still on
Kappa
Tim took it off, mods killing everyone
The mods are cool, stop being mad leonys
RIOT
I'm confused nowFailFish
Pioxys is cool
Tim took it off to make alterations plus laptop is nearly kill
NightBat Tim is working out some kinks to the program plus its over heating. he said he will bring it back later
NightBat he just gotta run more test or something
Thank you
Tim's laptop blew up
uh oh
We could have kill Tim laptop Kappa
what happened to tim?
it went KA BOOM
Well, almost blew up
Tim left to dump his laptop into liquid nitro
Did his laptop explode?
NightBat This is the beach boys fault Kappa
He signed off, Crzay
wondering why his laptop gets so hot...i mean it's emulation and streaming.  Shouldnt be thaaaaat hot
Too much TBB.
BPP now on list of explosive devices not allowed on planes
twitch muted tim's laptop
he probably doesn't have a cooling pad and who knows what his room is like
probably not air conditioned that's for sure
ah. So he just decided to kill the stream for now?
The stream crashed?
It was going for a long time, the concept stream + all of this
yeah, for now.
Probably too much TBB at max volume so he covered it in blankets and pillows to shut it up Kappa
ah, makes sense.
first test is officially over.
I just killed a fish and a laptop todayBloodTrail
NightBat he could do what i do. i make my laptop sit on a stand or chair and put it to the edge so the fan can blow out air
I mean, he's not doing this for viewers or anything
The stream is still going FailFish Kappa
BPP will be back
so he doesn't need to keep this running at all times.
NIghtBat wait the fish is dead?
the fish is always dead
I just put a fan in front of my computer.
Idk Pioxys
brb, unless i get banned again "mods"
I'm sad he's sleeping instead of streaming on regular channel timMrBones
oh yeah
NightBat if ya do just let someone know for me leonys
hope we get regular stream
The fish is just sleeping Kappa
He did promise us one Kappa
Fish joined illuminati will be releasing a music video with hidden messages soon
Well running this was probably causing his computer to over hear .-.
Have to go byeKappa /
That reminds me I need to sleep, it's 2am here
at least his laptop didn't blue screen
like last time
^
Over hear Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
Whoa
Guys, the person below me is a Kappa!
hey guys.
Hah
NightBat its offline not googled up. inb4  AW SNAP
Wait, tim slept until 1pm EDT and now he's going back to sleep?
NightBat hi fusion
Tim needs sleep
he's a growing man child
Hiya
Plot twist - Tim is Grayson
Exactly, thumbs. Exactly
So, apparently, I'm a Kappa.
Well, he always goes offline on Not_Tim a few hours before he streams on the main channel.
Even bigger plot twist: We are Grayson
Maybe that's what's going on?
maybe
well he does need coffee for main stream...maybe that's his breakfast
he needs to drink more monotonetea, it's full of vitamins and peppermint.
Later M80s
Maybe he's on a multi-phase sleep schedule :o
oh man, you know what that reminds me?
Kappa//
I never watched his reaction to drinking it. I remember him talking about someone sending it to him and him talking about it
but I never saw him drinking it
I missed that as well.
Pretty sure my power went out that night and I forgot to go watch the vod
well it's gonna be lost someday.
At least I know that it somehow wasn't the best thing ever made.
I cant remember what stream it was though
Can't get over the box art that was made for it though.
cough http://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=67675

GRAYSON IS GONE
where is the beats BibleThump
we are waiting for the return of the beats
chat is ded

return of the beats
Is tim streaming tonight?
what happened
Soo the Stream is offline for some time...
Its over for a while
o
Tim went to sleep, and he wants to find ways to make it better
what happened
ohh ok
Why did Tim take this offline?
Grayson may be Alive Kappa
Hes perfecting it, and sleeping
perfecting it offline this will be good Kappa
Grayson got a new tank Kappa
Grayson went to the big tank in the sky. Kappa
